# Notes

Benchmarking [BigNum lib](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-bignum) on mobile.

This project was created using https://github.com/madztheo/noir-react-native-starter

Note:
- only tested for iOS (iPhone 15 Pro)
- srs download didn't work for specific circuits. Default srs did work. (Might have to report issue)
- U4096 will cause crash because it uses too much memory (does the srs suffice here?)
